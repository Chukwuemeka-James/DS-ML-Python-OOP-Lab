    "## **Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features. It allows us to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. In OOP, **Abstraction** is typically achieved using **abstract classes** and **abstract methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Abstraction:\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated directly. It often contains one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "- **Abstract Method**: A method declared in an abstract class that does not have an implementation. Subclasses must implement the abstract method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Abstraction in Action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Abstract Class and Abstract Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract class** is used when we want to define a template for other classes, but we do not want to allow the instantiation of the base class itself. It may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by any derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Simple Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple example, we define an abstract class `Employee` with an abstract method `calculate_salary()`. Any subclass of `Employee` will need to provide its implementation for `calculate_salary()`."
