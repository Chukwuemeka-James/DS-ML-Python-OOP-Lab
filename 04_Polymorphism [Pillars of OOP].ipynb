    "## **Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows the same method or function to behave differently based on the object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism\n",
    "1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**\n",
    "   - Achieved through **method overloading** or **operator overloading**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**\n",
    "   - Achieved through **method overriding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Polymorphism in Action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Method Overloading** (Compile-Time Polymorphism)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Overloading** happens when multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or numbers exist in the same class. This allows the function to operate differently depending on the number and type of arguments passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Python does not support method overloading directly, but we can achieve it using default arguments or variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Simple Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `calculate_salary()` method can handle both `hours worked` and `years of experience` to compute the salary of an employee."
